Sanjay wants to learn the calculation of integer digits.could you please help him to implements the sum of digits in programming. Notes:- - If the integer is 45,separate the each digits (4+5) the output is 9.
# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
n=int(input())
if(n>=9 and n<=99):
    a=n//10
    b=n%10
    print(f"Sum of Digit {n} is {a+b:03d}")
else:
    print("Invalid Input")
