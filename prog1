Write a Python program to read the monthly salary of a person and his expenses under four categories: bank loan, hostel fees, food expenses, and parentsâ€™ support.
salary=int(input())
bank=int(input())
hostel=int(input())
food=int(input())
parents=int(input())
spend=bank+hostel+food+parents
if(spend<salary):
    print("He can save money")
elif(spend==salary):
        print("He can manage his expense")
else:
            print("He want to work hard")
