Kumar wants to learn how the calculators are working.so he is trying to implements the calculator program.could you please help him to implements the program. - Notes:- Must use the Switch Case.operators - Addition - Subtraction - Multiplication - Division - Modulo

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
op = input()
if op == '+':
    print(f"Addition of two number is {float(a + b)}")
elif op == '-':
    print(f"Subtraction of two number is {float(a - b)}")
elif op == '*':
    print(f"Multiplication of two number is {float(a * b)}")
elif op == '/':
    if b == 0:
        print("Division by zero is not allowed")
    else:
        print(f"Division of two number is {float(a / b)}")
elif op == '%':
    if b == 0:
        print("Modulo by zero is not allowed")
    else:
        print(f"Modulo of two number is {float(a % b)}")
else:
    print("Invalid Input")
