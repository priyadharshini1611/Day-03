Write a Python program to read the current balance and perform deposit or withdrawal based on user choice. If deposit, add amount; if withdrawal, check balance and update or show "insuff balance".
balance_amt= int(input())
process= int(input())
if (process ==1):
 dep_amt=int(input())
 print ("Deposit")
 print ("the current balance is", balance_amt + dep_amt)
elif (process == 2):
 Withdr_amt=int (input ())
 print("Withdraw")
 if (balance_amt > Withdr_amt):
   print ("The current balance is", balance_emt-Withdr_amt)
 else:
    print ("insuff belance")
else:
    print("Invalid i/p")
