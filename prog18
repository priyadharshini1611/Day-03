In a theater, there is a discount scheme announced where one gets a 10% discount on the total cost of tickets when there is a bulk booking of more than 20 tickets, and a discount of 2% on the total cost of tickets if a special coupon card is submitted. Develop a program to find the total cost as per the scheme. The cost of the k class ticket is Rs.75 and q class is Rs.150. Refreshments can also be opted by paying an additional of Rs. 50 per member.
**Hint: **k and q and You have to book minimum of 5 tickets and maximum of 40 at a time. If fails display “Minimum of 5 and Maximum of 40 Tickets”. If circle is given a value other than ‘k’ or ‘q’ the output should be “Invalid Input”.
The ticket cost should be printed exactly to two decimal places.

n=int(input())
ref=input()
cou=input()
tic=input()
if (n<5 or n>40):
    print("Minimum of 5 and Maximum of 40 tickets")
elif (tic!='k' and tic!='q'):
    print("Invalid Input")
else:
    if tic=='k':
        cost=75
    else:
        cost=150
    total=n*cost
    if ref=='y':
        total=total+50*n
    if n>20:
        total=total-total*(10/100) 
    if cou=='y':
        total=total-(n*cost)*(2/100)
    print(f"Ticket cost:{total:.2f}")
