# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
a=input()
b=int(input())
c=int(input())
d=int(input())
e=int(input())
f=int(input())
total_marks=b+c+d+e+f
avg_marks=(total_marks)/5
print(f"Name of the Student:{a}")
print(f"Total Mark:{total_marks}")
print(f"Average Mark:{avg_marks}")
avg_marks=int(avg_marks)
if(avg_marks==100):
    print("Grade Mark:S")
elif(avg_marks>=90 and avg_marks<=99):
    print("Grade Mark:A")
